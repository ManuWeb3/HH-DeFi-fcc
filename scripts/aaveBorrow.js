//  Risk parameters analysis:
/*  Loan To value:
    The Loan to Value (LTV) ratio defines the maximum amount of currency that can be borrowed with a specific collateral. 
    Itâ€™s expressed in percentage: at LTV=75%, for every 1 ETH worth of collateral, borrowers will be able to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of the corresponding currency. 
    Once a loan is taken, the LTV evolves with market conditions. 
*/

/*  Liquidation Threshold:    
    The liquidation threshold is the percentage at which a loan is defined as undercollateralised. 
    For example, a Liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the loan is undercollateralised and could be liquidated.
    The delta between the Loan-To-Value and the Liquidation Threshold is a safety cushion for borrowers.
